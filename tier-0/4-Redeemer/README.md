## Connect to the machine
1. First, ensure you are connected to the Hack The Box network by configuring your VPN: `sudo openvpn [your-config-file.ovpn]`
2. Spawn the machine from the HTB dashboard. You will be assigned a target IP address.

## Task Breakdown
**1. Which TCP port is open on the machine?**
- To discoveropen ports, run `sudo nmap -p- -sV --min-rate 5000 [IP-Address]`. The `--min-rate 5000` ensures the scan runs faster by sending 5000 packets per second. This can significantly reduce the time needed to scan all 65,535 ports.

**9. How many keys are present inside the database with index 0?**
- After selecting database, we can list all keys using `keys *`
![keys](img/keys.png)
- **Answer:** 4

**10. Which command is used to obtain all the keys in a database?**
- **Answer:** keys *

## Submit the flag
